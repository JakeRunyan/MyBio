Bio

<p> Hello my name is Jake Runyan, I call the stunning landscapes of Utah my home, where I’ve been raised to appreciate the beauty of both nature 
and technology. I’m all about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of computing.</p>

<p> Pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Weber State University, I’m building a solid foundation that 
fuels my passion for innovation. Oh, and I’m not just stopping there—I’ve earned multiple AWS certifications, 
showcasing my commitment to mastering cloud technologies that are shaping the future.</p>

<p> The thrill of unraveling complex problems is my kind of adventure. With the right tools and a genuine love for 
developing software, I dive into projects headfirst. I believe that software should do more than just function; 
it should make a real impact. That’s why I’m not satisfied until I’ve crafted efficient, innovative solutions 
that truly make a difference.</p>
